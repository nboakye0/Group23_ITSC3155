Individual Report 1
Eliza Deguzman
Team 23

1.	Goals from Last Report
  a.	None since this is the first report
2.	Progress
  a.	For the first milestone, our team divided the features equally, so I did 3.
  b.	Our communication method on Discord really helped since it’s easier and you can tell when people are online or not.
  c.	I learned a little bit more about Git. I’m still trying to get use to all the commands and how to use it, but I think I’m starting to get the hang of it more.
  d.	Since we are using Git a lot, I’m starting to get use to it. How the activities are laid out in quiz form on Canvas is helpful.
  e.	I don’t think I’ve gotten stuck anywhere for this week. The only thing I can think of getting stuck at is if there is miscommunication with members in the team. Example: if one person didn’t do their part. So far that hasn’t happened, so that’s great.
3.	Goals for This Week
  a.	Start considering different ethical considerations when it comes to our Q&A forum.
  b.	Start brainstorming about the front-end wiring of the team’s program.
  c.	Remind everyone weekly about our deadlines on discord. 
  d.	Don’t fall behind on deadlines!
  e.	Keep communication open between team members.
